# Leaderboard-creation
In this project there are two execel files given named input1 and input2.
I have read them in puthon and created two files output and output2 giving the leaderboard.
in ouput 1 ranking is judged on bases of total number of statements and reasons and if they are same for two persons then their rankings in judged based on their name in alphabetical order ignoring their case.
While in output2 ranking of teams are predicted based on sum of average of statements and reasons.
